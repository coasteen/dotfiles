## README - Coast's dotfiles

Most of these dotfiles are oldies — my newer ones live in my <u><a href="https://codeberg.org/coast/home-manager/">home-manager</a></u> configuration.  
If you want shiny, modern dotfiles, make sure you have <u><a href="https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/">Nix Home Manager</a></u> installed, then run:
*Make sure you have <u><a href="https://nixos.org/download/">Nix Package Manager</a></u> installed first!*

```bash
cd ~/.config && mkdir home-manager
git clone https://codeberg.org/coast/home-manager.git
nix run home-manager -- init --switch .
```

I think these commands will set up home-manager with my quirky configuration.
But to be brutally honest, please don’t use mine — you deserve way better! :3 Like your own setup! Mine’s kinda ass. I love ass.

### Disclaimer
*These dotfiles reflect my personal preferences and workflow. They might not be suitable for everyone and could require adjustments to fit your needs.*
*They were set up how I learned how to set it up, you might not like how I've set up my program(s)' configuration files in this repository. I strongly recommend that you write your own configs.*
*Feel free to fork, modify, or use parts of this configuration as an inspiration for your own setup.*

### Open source
[=] I recommend you write your own configs for your programs but you're always free to take these dotfiles and make changes to them and redistribute them. I don't say they're good dots tho
